# Bootcamp Module 5: Third Party APIs, Challenge: Work Day Planner

## The goal of this project is to create a daily planner for standard work hours in which the user can enter tasks in the time slots, those tasks are then saved to local storage, and the time slots change colors to indicate times that are past (gray), current (red), and future (green). 

### The starter code included a basic HTML outline, to which I added the time slots using a Bootstrap grid layout. I used moment.js for the date at the top of the planner and to get the hour time which was needed for changing the background colors according to the above mentioned conditions. 

#### My planner page was built using [Git Hub Pages](https://mcamy2001.github.io/daily-planner/).

#### I had a tutoring session with Michelle Jordan while working on this project. We discussed saving items to local storage, retrieving them from local storage, and using moment.js to update color backgrounds.
